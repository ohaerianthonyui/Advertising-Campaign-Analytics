Analyzing Advertisement Campaigns and Predicting Click Through Rate

---

## Project Introduction

In today’s competitive digital landscape, marketing campaigns across multiple platforms such as Google Ads and Facebook Ads play a crucial role in driving customer engagement and conversions. However, managing and optimizing these campaigns requires a deep understanding of how various factors—such as audience demographics, campaign types, communication mediums, and creative assets—impact performance metrics like impressions, clicks, and link clicks.

This project aims to analyze marketing campaign data from October 2019 to July 2020, sourced from Google and Facebook campaigns. The objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights regarding the effectiveness of campaigns across different platforms, age groups, devices, and creatives. Furthermore, we develop machine learning models to predict campaign performance automatically, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize marketing strategies.

Through this analysis, we seek to provide actionable recommendations for targeting the right audience, selecting the most impactful creatives, and allocating budget efficiently across channels to maximize return on investment.
